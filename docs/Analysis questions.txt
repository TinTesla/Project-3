Data manipulation and plotting for patterns:

Attributes were measured against each other to see if there were strong correlations between certain attributes and song popularity (popularity is one of the attributes using a ranking rather than a rating)
Average attribute levels were calculated for each year to see how the average changed over time
Created data frame for each decade to look at changes in correlations during different decades
